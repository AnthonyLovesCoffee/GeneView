# Rodent Research-23 Mission (RR-23) Summary

## Treatment Applied to Each Group
- **Flight Group**: Twenty male mice were sent to space, maintained in microgravity on the ISS for 38 days, and then returned to Earth for post-flight procedures, tissue collection, and analysis.
- **Habitat Ground Control (HGC) Group**: Twenty mice remained on Earth in rodent habitats designed to simulate the conditions of spaceflight without microgravity exposure. These mice were treated as controls for the spaceflight group.
- **Vivarium Ground Control (VGC)**: Twenty mice remained in standard vivarium cages on Earth as another control group, representing normal living conditions without the spaceflight-related factors or special habitats.


In total, 60 mice were included in the study. All groups underwent similar post-treatment procedures, including tissue collection, RNA extraction, and sequencing.

## Events Leading up to the Launch of the Experiment
1. **Sourcing and Housing**: Twenty male C57BL/6J mice (16-17 weeks old) were sourced and prepared for spaceflight.
2. **Pre-Flight Preparation**: Mice were loaded onto SpaceX-21 on December 6, 2020, for transport to the International Space Station (ISS).
3. **Transfer to ISS Habitats**: Upon arrival at the ISS, the mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats and maintained in microgravity for 38 days.
4. **Microgravity Experiment**:  Mice were subjected to microgravity conditions during the mission to study the effects of spaceflight on ocular and vascular systems.

## Events Following the Return of the Experiment
1. **Live Animal Return (LAR)**: On January 13, 2021, the mice returned to Earth after splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean and were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center.
2. **Transport to Texas A&M**: Mice were flown to Texas A&M University for post-flight analysis.
3. **Euthanasia and Tissue Collection**: Post-flight procedures were carried out at Texas A&M, including euthanasia and the collection of muscle samples for RNA extraction.
4. **RNA Sequencing**: Muscle samples were preserved, and RNA extraction was performed, followed by sequencing and data analysis.

## Context from Similar Experiments
Other experiments within NASAâ€™s **Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)** have utilized **rodent models in spaceflight** to study various biological responses. Similar studies have focused on the effects of microgravity on organs such as the liver, spleen, and muscles. Many of these experiments also utilized RNA sequencing to explore gene expression changes due to spaceflight. Additionally, like RR-23, these studies often included **ground control** and **baseline control groups** to differentiate spaceflight-specific effects from environmental influences.
