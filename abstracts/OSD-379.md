# Abstract

## Treatment Applied to Each Group
- **ISS Terminal (ISS-T)**: Ten young (10-12 week-old) and ten old (32 week-old) female BALB/cAnNTac mice were flown to the ISS and sacrificed on-orbit after 22-23 days.
- **Live Animal Return (LAR)**: The other ten young and ten old mice were returned to Earth alive after 40 days in space and sacrificed after a 2-day recovery.
- **Ground Controls**: Each spaceflight group (both ISS-T and LAR) had corresponding **Habitat Ground Controls (HGC)** (10 mice each, housed in similar conditions to flight mice) and **Vivarium Ground Controls (VGC)** (10 mice each, housed in standard lab conditions).
- **Basal Controls**: Mice sacrificed 1 day after launch to establish baseline conditions (10 mice).

In total, 160 mice were included in the study, with data on liver samples gathered from each group.

## Events Leading up to the Launch of the Experiment
1. **Sourcing and Housing**: All mice were sourced from Taconic Biosciences and shipped to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) around 4 weeks before launch. Initially, they were housed in standard cages with 5 mice per cage, fed standard lab chow, and had access to water and enrichment items like igloos.
2. **Pre-Flight Preparation**: At L-3 weeks, mice were moved to raised mesh floors to simulate spaceflight cage conditions. They were transitioned to NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB) and water from lixits.
3. **Social Acclimation**: At L-10 days, mice were regrouped into larger cages (10 mice per cage) to prepare for spaceflight conditions. The groupings were adjusted to ensure similar average weights.
4. **Loading into Transporters**: At L-1 day, spaceflight mice were loaded into spaceflight transporters, while ground control mice (HGC and VGC) were also loaded, with the HGC mice experiencing a 3-day offset.

## Events Following the Return of the Experiment
1. **Live Animal Return (LAR)**: After the 40-day mission, spaceflight mice (LAR group) were returned to Earth but experienced double-density housing for about 7 days due to bad weather, adding stress. Mice were sacrificed after 2 days of recovery on Earth.
2. **Liver Sample Collection**: Both ISS-T and LAR groups, along with their ground controls, had liver samples collected and processed following identical protocols. Livers were dissected into individual lobes and preserved at -80°C or lower throughout transport and storage.
3. **Mold Contamination**: Both spaceflight and habitat ground control mice experienced mold contamination in their food, while the VGC and Basal control mice had uncontaminated food.
4. **RNA Sequencing**: Liver samples underwent RNA extraction and sequencing using Illumina NovaSeq, with ERCC spike-in controls for quality assessment.

## Context from Similar Experiments
Other experiments within NASA’s **Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)** have utilized **rodent models in spaceflight** to study various biological responses. Similar studies have focused on the effects of microgravity on organs such as the liver, spleen, and muscles. Many of these experiments also utilized RNA sequencing to explore gene expression changes due to spaceflight. Additionally, like RRRM-1, these studies often included **ground control** and **baseline control groups** to differentiate spaceflight-specific effects from environmental influences.
